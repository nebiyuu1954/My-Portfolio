## ðŸ”µ Project Contributions
As the sole developer, I:

- **Designed and Developed Responsive UI**: Built a responsive portfolio using React 19 and Tailwind CSS, ensuring compatibility across desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- **Implemented Interactive Skills Slider**: Created a looping slider in `Skills.jsx` with `skills.css`, showcasing 20+ skills with SVG icons and hover effects.
- **Integrated and Managed Assets**: Added 20+ SVG icons in `src/assets/logos/` (e.g., HTML5, MySQL, Django) and enabled resume download (`NebiyuEsaiyas.pdf`).
- **Deployed to Vercel**: Deployed the site to Vercel, resolving layout and asset issues for a seamless experience at [https://nebiyu-esaiyas.vercel.app/](https://nebiyu-esaiyas.vercel.app/).
- **Optimized Full-Width Layouts**: Fixed landing and Skills sections to span full width without horizontal scrollbars using `App.css` and `skills.css`.
